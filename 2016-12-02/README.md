So I've been accepted into the Recurse Center (https://www.recurse.com/) for Spring 1, 2017.
In a couple days my journey with McKinsey will come to an end and I will focus on the future,
with May 2017 as a target for my next job.

### Interview process at RC

Smooth and pleasant. Actually the smoothest I've ever had in my experience as a software developer.

You get a link to a page where you can see how your application is going, who you talked to
and who you're going to talk to.

The interviews are relaxed and focused on understanding if you're a good for RC and if
RC is a good for you. No pressure or anything like that, just a chat like you have with a
colleague over lunch about that new interesting technology.
