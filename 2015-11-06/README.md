# Thoughts on interviews

"Disruptive startup, ground breaking startup" usually helps me a lot in finding where I don't want to go.

These were actual interview experiences I went through, I do not want in any to criticise these employers way of interviewing people, rather I want to use their examples to reason about my point of view.

### Phone, strong foreign accent, difficult to understand exercise

I wasn't sure 

### Here's a challenge, we will never answer back though

This is the absolute worst.

If you company has a live challenge that starts after a `curl` on some URL make it invalid (410 gone?), or make it more difficult, so that if someone gets it right you definitely want that person in your team.<br />
Never forget to reply, it's extremely rude to the person which took the time and effort to finish the challenge.

### Here's a challenge, we will mark you down for things in the specs

If you say that, for example

> the input can come from stdin or file

make sure that you clearly state that

 * the solution should accept both
 * the solution can accept one or the other, just document it

Because it's important that you don't mark people down for actually following the specs.

### This is our challenge, there are many like it, but this one is ours

> "You are given the task to design and ultimately code a URL shortner service, how do you approach the problem?"

There are three possible scenarios here:

* you heard this before 

and you work your way through as a pro, possibly not rushing too much, 

* you are a pretty good engineer 

you are not feeling the pressure of coming up with "The Good Reasoning And Thoughts" every employer wants to hear / see on the whiteboard and work your way 

* you start thinking about it

I am here. 8 years ago or something like that I tried setting up a service for uploading images with a short url as result, but it's not something I recall with proud and it never worked out in practice. So I might say I tried but the gained experience wasn't enough for me to level up.

### The interviewer is surprised by your solution

But you still feel bad about it. I want to be surprised by them, not the other way around.<br />
I understand this might be personal, but I tend to agree with the "don't be the smartest person in the room", in the sense that I would like to pass an interview just barely, I'd like to join a team where I barely have enough experience (probably experience is a better comparison term than smartness) to be there.
