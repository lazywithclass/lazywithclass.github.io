# Thoughts on interviews

Disruptive startup, ground breaking startup

### Phone, strong foreign accent, difficult to understand exercise


### Here's a challenge, we will never answer back though


### This is our challenge. There are many like it, but this one is ours

> "You are given the task to design and ultimately code a URL shortner service, how do you approach the problem?"

There are three possible scenarios here:

1. you heard this before 

and you work your way through as a pro, possibly not rushing too much, 

2. you are a pretty good engineer 

you are not feeling the pressure of coming up with "The Good Reasoning And Thoughts" every employer wants to hear / see on the whiteboard and work your way 

3. you start thinking about it

I am here. 8 years ago or something like that I tried setting up a service for uploading images with a short url as result, but it's not something I recall with proud and it never worked out in practice. So I might say I tried but the gained experience wasn't enough for me to level up.
