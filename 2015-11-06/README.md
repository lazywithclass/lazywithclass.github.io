# Thoughts on interviews

"Disruptive startup, ground breaking startup" usually helps me a lot in finding where I don't want to go.

These were actual interview experiences I went through, I do not want in any to criticise these employers way of interviewing people, rather I want to use their examples to reason about my point of view.

[tl;dr](#a-proposal)

### Phone, strong foreign accent, difficult to understand exercise

I wasn't sure 

### Here's a challenge, we will never answer back though

This is the absolute worst.

If you company has a live challenge that starts after a `curl` on some URL make it invalid (410 gone?), or make it more difficult, so that if someone gets it right you definitely want that person in your team.<br />
Never forget to reply, it's extremely rude to the person which took the time and effort to finish the challenge.

### Here's a challenge, we will mark you down for things in the specs

If you say that, for example

> the input can come from stdin or file

make sure that you clearly state that

 * the solution should accept both
 * the solution can accept one or the other, just document it

Because it's important that you don't mark people down for actually following the specs.

### This is our challenge, there are many like it, but this one is ours

> "You are given the task to design and ultimately code a URL shortner service, how do you approach the problem?"

There are three possible scenarios here:

* you heard this before 

and you work your way through as a pro, possibly not rushing too much, 

* you are a pretty good engineer 

you are not feeling the pressure of coming up with "The Good Reasoning And Thoughts" every employer wants to hear / see on the whiteboard and work your way 

* you start thinking about it

I am here. 8 years ago or something like that I tried setting up a service for uploading images with a short url as result, but it's not something I recall with proud and it never worked out in practice. So I might say I tried but the gained experience wasn't enough for me to level up.

### The interviewer is surprised by your solution

But you still feel bad about it. I want to be surprised by them, not the other way around.<br />
I understand this might be personal, but I tend to agree with the "don't be the smartest person in the room", in the sense that I would like to pass an interview just barely, I'd like to join a team where I barely have enough experience (probably experience is a better comparison term than smartness) to be there.

### Phone interview, we can't see you, you can't see us

Asking what is an array in a phone interview might be the Most Difficult Question Ever.<br />
Ok probably just for me, but try getting it slightly wrong, you make a pause and hear nothing from the other side, even for a few seconds (which is pretty normal if phone conversations) but in this case it could upset you "Did I really just got the definition of array wrong?!?" "Why are they silent?".

For sure you can be proactive and help yourself asking questions to understand if you're headed in the right direction, my point here is that any question, asked on a phone interview, or in an interview where you can't see the interviewer, becomes more difficult.

## A proposal

Scan through the resume - does the person list the skills you need?
Phone interview - is the person a pleasant individual, and roughly knows a couple random things he listed?
Onsite / Skype interview - technical, relevant questions
