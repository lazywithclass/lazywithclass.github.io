## COMP300E and struggle on dynamic programming

So... I've stopped for a while trying to solve [this homework](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/hw/hw4.pdf),
I finally am sure I spent too much time on it without finding a good way to approach it, I will then
go with COMP300E course (still taught by prof Skiena) and see if that helps me figuring out where I am failing.

COMP300E seems to be taking a similar path to CSE373, with a practical twist, so hopefully this is a good move.

### Lecture 1 - Getting Started

First thing one notices is that this course has much better video, there's a camera that zooms
onto the whiteboard, something that never happened in CSE373, which led to very difficult to understand 
passages in some of the lectures.
