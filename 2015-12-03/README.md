# Ramblings on pair programming and pull requests

Pair programming and pull requests.

[tl;dr](#tl;dr)


Comparison of time

The amount of time spent pair programming is greater than that spent reviewing, this is because you are exploring the possible solutions, discussing alternatives, etc.


### In pair programming you

 * work with a colleague on the task 
 * spend the same amount of time looking / discussing together the code, implementing or testing
 * write every line (and probably rewrite it multiple times) with another person looking at it
 * create something, it's an active process
 * invest all the time that is required to do whatever is your task

### In pull requests you

* are alone, you could ask questions and clarifications sure
* have to understand why something is that way, without the thought process 
* do not have the social aid of someone sitting near you, helping, you could sure but the other person is not going to stay near you for the whole process, everytime you are going through a review
* evaluate something, it's a passive process
* usually do not spend other than a small fraction of what the people who coded spent
* review the code along with other people, let's say 2+

Or probably I've been doing this wrong the whole time.

#### tl;dr

I feel pair programming to be vastly superior to pull requests, my view is that you could pair program and use pull requests, or just pair program, but not just use pull requests.
