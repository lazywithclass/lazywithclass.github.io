### Following on dynamic programming

I am not saying in any way that the following are bad examples of how to teach Dynamic Programming,
it's just that they didn't work for me:

 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M
 
This didn't help me understanding the subject, unfortunately at a point it takes a "math
approach", which does not really work with me.

He goes through the example showing each single step but still, not clear to me in the end
what would be the solution in code or how should I approach this class of problems.

Good thing I've found in this last link is a link to https://github.com/mission-peace/interview/wiki/Dynamic-Programming,
which lists problems and also offers solutions, this can prove really useful.
