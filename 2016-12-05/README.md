# Attending the Recurse Center

So I've been accepted into the Recurse Center (https://www.recurse.com/) for Spring 1, 2017.

### Interview process at RC

Smooth and pleasant. Actually the smoothest I've ever had in my experience as a software developer.

You get a link to a page where you can see how your application is going, who you talked to
and who you're going to talk to.

The interviews are relaxed and focused on understanding if you're a good fit for RC and if
RC is a good fit for you. No pressure or anything like that, just a chat like you would have with a
colleague over lunch about that new interesting technology.

### The Plan

The idea is to prepare for interviews that will hopefully happen once RC has finished.

I am following a couple guides to stay focused on the goal:

 * https://github.com/lazywithclass/google-interview-university/blob/master/README.md
 * https://github.com/MaximAbramchuck/awesome-interview-questions

And a few courses:

 * https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses
 * https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DV69F32zdK7YJcNXpTunF2b - CSE373 - Analysis of Algorithms, course taught by Professor Steven Skiena
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dkbFf82_b8&list=PL07B3F10B48592010 - COMP300E (Programming Challenges), course taught by Professor Steven Skiena
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo - MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms

### Tracking progress

To track progress I am going to blog my everyday's findings, I don't think I will do this every day, but it would nice to keep a tab
on how I am doing.

There are 175 days left (https://days.to/31-may/2017), so I believe there's plenty of time to get everything done.
