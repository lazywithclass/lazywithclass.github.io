I did the 3n+1 and Minesweeper problems, sadly I did those in JavaScript,
but [the judge](http://www.programming-challenges.com/) only accepts a few
languages, so I think I'll have to go back to Java.

I am already regretting this decision just by staring at 
[the template](http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=javainfo) 
you have to use, but whatever.

All my attempts will be in [my katas repo](https://github.com/lazywithclass/katas).
