## COMP300E problems and tinder (-128)

I've decided to stick with JavaScript. So I've found https://www.udebug.com, which contains
inputs and solutions for the problems prof Skiena is using.

Great improvement.

### Tinder 

I've messing with Tinder APIs for quite some now, I did not publish anything yet.
My goal is to be able to extract useful information from the local people, for example
"What do women (or men) in London are looking for in partners?" might be a good question
to answer, or "What's the predominant look in Tinder photos in Paris?".

I don't have any idea on how to approach the problems. Something tells me machine learning
could be a start, another step could be by starting to look at the text in the various profiles.
I think that would be way easier than "understanding images".
