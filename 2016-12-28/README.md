### Dynamic programming

#### Dynamic Programming for Programming Competitions

This is actually quite interesting, applying those concepts to some "real world" use cases,
one of which will be the [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/posts/1356850017680516?notif_t=page_reengaged&notif_id=1482432873688739),
which I will try. In the past I've tried it a couple times, never being able to get past the second round, hopefully with this
tool I can go one round farther.

[The channel where that video comes from](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_WPHQksZpx_RoZysxQjFbg) seems to have a lot
of material on how to apply these concepts to programming competitions, I don't think I can get a job that way (too many
smarter people out here), but it will be a terrific exercise when I will be in front of The Whiteboard.
