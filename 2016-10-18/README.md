# Learning the cool kids' frontend practices

Because there's this thing where if you don't know something you go out of business.
Or at least there's where I am right now, not having enough experience.

## How

I will build a mashup of news that I find interesting, the steps are

 * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
 * [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
 * [Flux]https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#content)
 * [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
 * ?
 
I will build upon the previous highlighting what the next gives me in terms of 
  
  * lines of code
  * simplicity
  * ease to change
