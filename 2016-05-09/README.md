# Moving between tmux panes Ã  la Spacemacs

[tl;dr](#the-code)

Along with Spacemacs I work with a tmux session with all my projects opened, usually a single
project window consists in at least two panes, one for the server and one for the tests.

In [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) you move to window 2 with `SPC-2`. It's
pretty useful, especially when you have multiple files opened.

In tmux I used to move around using `C-a UP` if for example I wanted to go to the pane
above the current one, needless to say this feels awkward when you switch from one program 
to the other, so I tweaked the configuration a bit until I got the same behaviour in both.

### The code

In my .zshrc

```bash
tmux-select-pane-1() { tmux select-pane -t '1' }
zle -N tmux-select-pane-1
bindkey " 1" tmux-select-pane-1
```

So whenever I type `SPC-1` in rapid succession I move to pane 1.

To avoid having pane numbers starting from 0 I have this in my .tmux.conf

```
setw -g pane-base-index 1
```

I've found it useful to have the pane number in my `RPS1`, so I know where to switch, use this:

```
echo $(tmux display-message -p '#P')
```

### Drawbacks

You have to be careful when you write a space followed by a number (it happens in my workflow as I use 
[SCM breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze)), but it's a minor annoyance and I think
over time I'll get used to it.
